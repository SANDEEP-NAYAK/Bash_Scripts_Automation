All the bash scripts that i learn during my DevOps journey is committed here in this repo.

--For Automated_backup.sh--
1️⃣ Give it the necessary permissions using "chmod +x backup_script.sh". 
2️⃣ Specify the Directories: Run the script by providing the source directory and the backup directory as arguments. 
3️⃣ Done! The script will create a compressed tarball with your files, ensuring your data is secure.
