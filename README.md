# Bash_Scripts_Automation
All the bash scripts that i learn during my DevOps journey is committed here in this repo.

--For Automated_backup.sh--

1️⃣ Give it the necessary permissions using "chmod +x backup_script.sh". 

2️⃣ Specify the Directories: Run the script by providing the source directory and the backup directory as arguments. 

3️⃣ Done! The script will create a compressed tarball with your files, ensuring your data is secure.

--For AddUsers.sh--

- Give it the necessary permissions using "chmod +x backup_script.sh".
  
- Add as many as you want which is implemented by using while loop.
  
- reads the password silently on terminal
  
- uses add_user() function to add the users
  
- before adding the function checks whether the user has already been added or not
  
- exit the script anytime by pressing "y" against the correct prompt
